# ACM's Repository for Intro to Github Workshop
## Competition skeleton code! (and install instructions)

### Fork this repository and work on it in groups - may the best group get the donuts!

- To fork this repo, click the fork button amongst the buttons at the top of the repo.
- From there, you can assign collaborators from the settings of your forked repo.
  - Have your collaborators accept the request, then clone your repository, make their own branches, and work on seperate parts / pages that you want to add!
  - (Try to work on different bits of the page. Merge conflicts suck.)
- Push your branches to your repo when you're done, and you should be able to merge them to the main branch through a pull request (a big green button to do it will show up.)
- You can deploy your website to an actual webpage by going to **Settings > Pages > Branch > main**

- If you're unclear about anything - the slides I went through with detailed instructions for most commands and actions will be posted to `#announcements` on our [discord](https://discord.gg/6AzbZxhX). If you're still confused, flag down an e-board member and we'll come by to assist!

If you have any questions - ask us! Have a great time and may the best team win!
